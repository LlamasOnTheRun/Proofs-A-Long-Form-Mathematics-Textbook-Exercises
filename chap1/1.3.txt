Definition of a "perfect cover": A perfect cover of a m*n board with 2*1 dominoes is an arrangement of thse dominos on the chessboard with no squares left uncovered, & no domions stacked or left hanging off the end

(a) Does there exist a perfect cover of the m*n chessboard? (m & n can be the same or different)

Scratch Notes:

Case 1: odd*odd

A 1*1 certainly can't fit a 2*1 domino

Neither can a 3*3 = 9

|P|P|J|
|L|L|J|
|K|K|X| <---

Therefore, odd * odd is invalid

Case 2: Even*Odd

2*3 = 6 is possible

|P|P|J|
|L|L|J|

7*5 = 35

|L|L|K|K|L|
|I|I|P|P|L|
|L|L|H|H|N|
|Q|Q|Y|Y|N|
|Z|Z|N|N|M|
|H|V|V|X|M|<--- Uh Oh!
|H|Q|Q|O|O|

Proof:
Given a chessboard is m*n, consider two cases:

Case 1: The Mutiplication of m*n is odd

If m*n is odd, then a 2*1 domino cannot evenly be distributed to the chessboard. Considering 2 spaces of the chessboard are taken away each time a donimo is placed, an arrival of having 1 empty spaces will occur due to an odd number of spaces being avaliable. 

Case 2: The Mutiplication of m*n is even

If m*n is even, then a 2*1 domino can evenly be distributed to the chessboard. Considering 2 spaces of the chessboard are taken away each time a donimo is placed, an arrival of having 0 empty spaces will occur due to an even number of spaces being avaliable.

Considering the two cases, we can sum up that:

If (m*n)%2 == 0, then a perfect cover exists

(b) If I remove 1 square from the m*n chessboard, will it have a perfect cover

Scratch Notes:

4*4

|P|M|L|L|
|P|M|O|O|
|Z|N|X| |
|Z|N|W|W|

If I take away anything here, I will not have a perfect cover

5*6=35

|L|L|K|K|L|
|I|I|P|P|L|
|L|L|X| |N|
|Q|Q|Y|Y|N|
|Z|Z|N|N|M|
|P|P|Q|Q|M|

If X was removed spot, does not work here

|L|L|K|K|L|
|I|I|P|P|L|
|L|L|Q|Q|N|
|Q|Q|Y|Y|N|
|Z|Z|N|N| |
|P|P|Q|Q|X|

Same applies if I were to move to end

3*3

|L|L|K|   
|A|X|K|
|A|G|G|   

Above works Coor(2,2)

|L|L|K|
|X| |K|
|G|G| |

The above does NOT work Coor(2,1)

|L|L|Y|
|K|K|Y|
|X|Z|Z|

The above does work Coor(3,1)

|L|L|X|
|K|K|H|
|Z|Z|H|

The above does work Coor(1,3)

So a odd * odd works, but only when we take away a square in a certain position

Preposition:

If the matrix is odd*odd & the spot taken away cannot be in these spots for it to be a perfect cover

| |X| |
|X| |X|
| |X| |

| |X| |X| |
|X| |X| |X|
| |X| |X| |
|X| |X| |X|
| |X| |X| |

Such that any Coor(Odd, Even) or Coor(Even, Odd) taken away in a odd*odd matrix will NOT lead to a perfect cover
