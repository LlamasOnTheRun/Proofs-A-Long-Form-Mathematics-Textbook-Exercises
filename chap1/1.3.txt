Definition of a "perfect cover": A perfect cover of a m*n board with 2*1 dominoes is an arrangement of thse dominos on the chessboard with no squares left uncovered, & no domions stacked or left hanging off the end

(a) Does there exist a perfect cover of the m*n chessboard? (m & n can be the same or different)

Scratch Notes:

Case 1: odd*odd

A 1*1 certainly can't fit a 2*1 domino

Neither can a 3*3 = 9

|P|P|J|

|L|L|J|

|K|K|X| <---

Therefore, odd * odd is invalid

Case 2: Even*Odd

2*3 = 6 is possible

|P|P|J|

|L|L|J|

7*5 = 35

|L|L|K|K|L|

|I|I|P|P|L|

|L|L|H|H|N|

|Q|Q|Y|Y|N|

|Z|Z|N|N|M|

|H|V|V|X|M|<--- Uh Oh!

|H|Q|Q|O|O|

Proof:
<p>
Given a chessboard is m*n, consider two cases:

Case 1: The Mutiplication of m*n is odd

If m*n is odd, then a 2*1 domino cannot evenly be distributed to the chessboard. Considering 2 spaces of the chessboard are taken away each time a donimo is placed, an arrival of having 1 empty spaces will occur due to an odd number of spaces being avaliable. 

Case 2: The Mutiplication of m*n is even

If m*n is even, then a 2*1 domino can evenly be distributed to the chessboard. Considering 2 spaces of the chessboard are taken away each time a donimo is placed, an arrival of having 0 empty spaces will occur due to an even number of spaces being avaliable.

Considering the two cases, we can sum up that:

If (m*n)%2 == 0, then a perfect cover exists
</p>
(b) If I remove 1 square from the m*n chessboard, will it have a perfect cover
