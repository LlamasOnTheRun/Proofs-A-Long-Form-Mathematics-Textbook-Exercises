As someone who teaches students (and sometimes mentors & co-workers) in the Chicago area, I find the growth mindset incredibly important to adopt. I myself also take on the growth mindset when I encounter diffucult problems in my everyday life. I tell myself that failure is not the end, but a fantastic teacher. That to learn a new concept is more rewarding that mastering the one kick a thousand times. The article "The Secret to Raising Smart Kids" certainly reinforces this idea which brings relief. It is important to note however I have already read books and material on this subject. Growing up at my High School, we were tasked with reading "Outliears" by Malcolm Gladwell to learn about what seperates the "geniuses" and those who are "deficient". What has always stuck with me is those who had innate ability will have short-term gains while those who have a learning mindset will outperfrom those who have that ability. I am living proof (funny enough) that with this mindset, we can set our sights on anything. And I still have more to learn :)
