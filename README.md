Note: I like you sometimes use github to look up anwers for difficult problems (I swear professor, I only do this when I really struggle). If you are this type of student, be aware, I have no idea if what I wrote or provided is correct. So reference with caution.

If you do reference and notice an error, please let me know in the issues tab. Would love to retry it if it is wrong.


My self-study approach will be the following:

Try 5 exercises with pre-written answers here: https://longformmath.com/proofs-hints-%26-solutions

Try 3 exercises that is 1-2 exercises away from the given 5 exercises (And it cannot have a prewritten answer!)

Ex. I Choose to do the pre-written answer exercise of 1.5. This means I can choose 1.3, 1.4, or 1.6. I cannot choose 1.7 because it already has a prewritten answer

It is best to choose the problems beforehand with the following conditions
