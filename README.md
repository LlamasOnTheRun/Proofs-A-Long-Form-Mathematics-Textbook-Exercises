Note: I like you sometimes use github to look up anwers for difficult problems (I swear professor, I only do this when I really struggle). If you are this type of student, be aware, I have no idea if what I wrote or provided is correct. So reference with caution.

If you do reference and notice an error, please let me know in the issues tab. Would love to retry it if it is wrong.
